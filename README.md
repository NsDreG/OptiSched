Click the button to navigate to the Workspace page.
Workspace Page
Download Template: Click Download Timetable Template to get the sample Excel file.
Upload Timetable: Upload your timetable (Excel .xlsx or CSV .csv) to start using the AI assistant.
Columns must be: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
Each row represents an activity. Empty cells indicate free time.
AI Assistant: Type your instructions (e.g., “Add Math test on Friday at 10:00”).
Currently, this is a placeholder for AI-powered timetable updates.
Timetable Display: Your uploaded or updated timetable is shown in a table.
You can download the updated timetable as CSV using the button below the table.
Navigation
Use the ← Back to Main Page button to return to the main page at any time.
All navigation is button-based; no other menus are required.
The app is designed to be easy to use, even without prior setup.
The timetable can be incrementally updated via the AI assistant (future AI integration will automatically add activities).
The app works entirely within the browser.
The template and uploaded timetables are kept in memory during the session.
